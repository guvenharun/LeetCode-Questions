First Loop (index = 0, num = 2):
- Calculated result:  
  result = target - num  
  result = 9 - 2 = 7
  
- Checking num_dict:  
  7 is not found in num_dict.
  
- Updating num_dict:  
  Add the current number with its index to the dictionary:  
  num_dict[2] = 0
  
- Status:  
  num_dict = {2: 0}

Second Loop (index = 1, num = 7):
- Calculated result:  
  result = target - num  
  result = 9 - 7 = 2
  
- Checking num_dict:  
  2 is found in num_dict.
  
- Function returns:  
  Since 2 is already in num_dict, return the indices [0, 1].
